Contribution
(get)  members can only access contributions made after they've joined
       This means that if someone becomes a member today, they won't have access to 
       contributions made before today, only those made from today onward. This ensures
       that each member can only access the contributions that are made during their time
       as a member and not contributions made before they joined.
